#### Single-line Summary
**Today, John and Adam paired together. It took about 2.5hrs**

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. First we removed the html for the JSON file to be copied and pasted into our data.
  2. Next, we installed the dependencies for the package.json.
  3. Then we launched the local host and made sure that the pages loaded.
  4. Next we went through and added comments for the code.
  5. We then added a new article and went into the postgres to find where the data was being stored.
